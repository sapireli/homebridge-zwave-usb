description="Implement the Homebridge Z-Wave USB plugin per GEMINI.md."
prompt = """
You are a senior TypeScript engineer. Implement the solution described in GEMINI.md.

Rules:
- Prefer small, reviewable commits (logical file changes grouped).
- Keep code readable and well-structured.
- Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.
- Add/update README and config.schema.json.
- Add tests (at least mapper unit tests + platform boot test).
- Run: !{npm test || true} and !{npm run build || true} and fix failures.

Implementation priorities:
1) Homebridge dynamic platform scaffold (boot, config parsing, logging)
2) zwave-js driver connection (serial/tcp)
3) discovery + accessory caching reconciliation
4) core mappers (contact, motion, leak, battery, switch/outlet)
5) controller accessory with inclusion/exclusion switches
6) tests + CI
