prompt = """
You are a strategist. Do NOT write or modify code. Output only a plan.

Goal: Build a Homebridge dynamic platform plugin that bridges Z-Wave USB controllers via zwave-js into HomeKit accessories, per GEMINI.md.

Steps:
1) Inspect repository structure and existing files.
2) Propose an implementation plan in phases with checkpoints.
3) Identify key APIs/events needed from Homebridge and zwave-js.
4) List risks and unknowns + how to validate them.
5) Define a test strategy and CI workflow.

If helpful, ask the user for any missing requirements ONLY after you've investigated the repo.
